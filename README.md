# COMP-4478-Assignment-2

The game has 8 images and a pair of each with a total of 16 cards. The user trys to match the pictures with the pairing image. You click any two images and 
they flip one at a time, if you get them correct those two cards will disappear and you will have a better chance of guessing where the other ones are. Then there is if the cards you chose are not pairing they flip back over and you have to chose different cards and try to remember where each card is located and which image it was and this way slowly but surely you guess and match the other cards.
